### Install, then describe your idea

Works with Cursor, Claude Code, Codex CLI, and OpenCode. See installation options below for additional integrations.

```bash
npx skills add tt-a1i/archify -g
```

Send this to your agent:

```text
Use Archify to diagram a web request: Browser calls the API,
the API checks Redis, and a cache miss queries PostgreSQL and fills the cache.
```

Then continue: “Add authentication”, “Highlight the cache-miss path”, or “Switch to the light theme”.

**No repository is required:** start with a description, or ask your agent to read a repository for a source-backed architecture diagram.

### Understand a real repository

<sub>CODE → DIAGRAM · A source-backed system map</sub>

[![MCO runtime architecture generated from the public mco-org/mco repository](docs/assets/mco-runtime-share-card.png)](https://tt-a1i.github.io/archify/cases/mco-runtime.architecture.html?theme=dark&present=1#view=dispatch-path)

Archify traced [`mco-org/mco`](https://github.com/mco-org/mco) at `9f1a1cf` and produced this checked map. **[Open it ↗](https://tt-a1i.github.io/archify/cases/mco-runtime.architecture.html?theme=dark&present=1#view=dispatch-path)** · [trace reach ↗](https://tt-a1i.github.io/archify/cases/mco-runtime.architecture.html?theme=dark#focus=router&reach=downstream) · [typed source](docs/cases/mco-runtime.architecture.json)

### Easy to extend. More ways to make it yours.

<sub>COMMUNITY STORIES · Selected examples shared by users</sub>

**Keep building after the diagram is generated.** Archify is open source and its output is standalone HTML. Ask your agent to adapt it, connect useful links, or add interactions for your own workflow. Community creations already span team collaboration, travel planning, legal citation checks, contract review, and incident retrospectives. These are just a few examples.

One user started with a hand-drawn multi-agent architecture, turned it into an interactive diagram, then added a Kimi execution pool through conversation. Others asked their agent to read a project and brought the resulting architecture into Feishu or DingTalk for team discussion.

Another user turned a Shanghai CityWalk guide into a four-day itinerary: switch between days, inspect a stop, and jump to Amap, Xiaohongshu, or Dianping. The author also added arrival check-ins and stop notes, turning the itinerary into a small tool to use during the trip. These extensions were added by the community author for this particular artifact.

### Download it. Open it. Explore it.

The output is a self-contained HTML file. Download it and open it in your browser to use the node details, path exploration, and guided chapters included in that artifact. No Archify installation is needed to view it. Send the HTML to someone else and the interactions go with it; external websites and map links need a network connection.

Use **Copy Share Card** when you want a canonical 1200×630 image for a README, release, or social post.

After tracing a route, **Export → Route Share Card** downloads that authored path as a 1200×630 PNG with the full diagram retained for context.

![Route Share Card showing the exact Users to API Server path with the full architecture retained as context](docs/assets/archify-route-share-card.png)

After tracing authored `Upstream` or `Downstream` reach, **Export → Reach Share Card** captures that exact reading without claiming runtime impact.

## Quick start

**Current development version:** `v2.17.0-dev.1`. See [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md#unreleased).

### 1. Install

```bash
npx skills add tt-a1i/archify -g
```

<details>
<summary>More installation options and update-check details</summary>

For an explicit, non-interactive Cursor install:

```bash
npx -y skills add tt-a1i/archify --skill archify --agent cursor --global --copy --yes
```

To try without installing:

```bash
npx skills use tt-a1i/archify@archify --agent codex
```

[DSH community opt-in](integrations/deepseek-harness/README.md): `dsh plugin --profile web add @tt-a1i/archify-dsh@0.1.0`

The [agent switcher](https://tt-a1i.github.io/archify/start.html?agent=cursor&type=architecture) covers `cursor`, `codex`, `claude-code`, and `opencode`. For Raven's manual ZIP install, extract [`archify.zip`](archify.zip) into `~/.raven/workspace/skills`; it yields `~/.raven/workspace/skills/archify`. Raven is not a switcher target.

Archify may GET the fixed stable manifest solely to show an optional reminder; it never downloads or installs updates. Successful checks wait about 72 hours (±20%); active use retries failures after 6, then 24 hours. The server sees normal HTTP metadata (IP and time), but receives no version, Agent, project data, prompts, account/device ID, or ETag. You decide whether and when to update. Set `ARCHIFY_UPDATE_CHECK_DISABLED=1` to disable networking and reminder-state writes.

</details>

### 2. Start from a description — no repository required

```text
Use Archify to draw: Browser -> API -> Redis cache -> PostgreSQL fallback.
```

For source evidence, open a repository and ask:

```text
Analyze this repository, then use archify to create a high-level runtime architecture diagram.
Show 8–12 core components, one primary path, external dependencies, and trust boundaries.
Put supporting detail in cards instead of adding more edges.
```

### 3. Refine in chat

Continue with focused requests such as `add Redis`, `move auth to the left`, or `highlight the rollback path`. Archify keeps the typed source available for targeted iteration.

## Choose the right diagram

<details>
<summary>Five diagram types, architecture comparisons, and examples</summary>


| Type | Best for | Include in your prompt |
|---|---|---|
| **Architecture** | Components, services, storage, boundaries | Scope, core components, primary path |
| **Workflow** | CI/CD, approvals, tool calls, runbooks | Participants, order, branches, exceptions |
| **Sequence** | API calls, cache fallback, auth, async traces | Callers, callees, returns, timing |
| **Data Flow** | Pipelines, lineage, PII, consumers | Sources, transforms, stores, boundaries |
| **Lifecycle** | States, retries, waits, terminal outcomes | States, events, retry and cancellation paths |

Architecture's optional `deployment-ownership` profile fails closed when authored owners, region placement, private database scope, or named crossings are missing; it is never implicit and does not inspect live infrastructure. See the [checked deployment proof](https://tt-a1i.github.io/archify/gallery.html#proof-deployment-ownership).

For design or PR review, Architecture Delta compares validated Before / Delta / After snapshots with a machine receipt. Select an authored change or play one finite, viewer-only Review; it infers no impact, risk, or merge safety.

`node archify/bin/archify.mjs compare architecture base.json head.json architecture-delta.html --json`

[![Architecture Delta showing added, removed, changed, and moved authored facts](docs/assets/architecture-delta-proof.jpg)](examples/checkout-platform-delta.html)

Not sure which one fits? Use the [interactive scenario guide](https://tt-a1i.github.io/archify/guide.html), or ask the zero-dependency CLI:

```bash
node archify/bin/archify.mjs guide "Show an API request with Redis cache miss"
node archify/bin/archify.mjs guide "Map Kafka topics, consumer groups, replay, and DLQ" --json
```

Workflow keeps the happy path clear across lanes:

![Workflow example](docs/assets/archify-workflow.png)

Sequence explains one interaction over time:

![Sequence example](docs/assets/archify-sequence.png)

Data Flow makes movement and sensitivity boundaries explicit:

![Data Flow example](docs/assets/archify-dataflow.png)

Lifecycle separates progress, waits, retries, and terminal outcomes:

![Lifecycle example](docs/assets/archify-lifecycle.png)

## Why Archify

| Understand the structure | Walk through the story |
|---|---|
| Map components, workflows, and relationships from code or a description. | Explore nodes, follow paths, and explain a process chapter by chapter. |
| **Extend it your way** | **Share the result** |
| Keep an editable source and build on the open-source code or generated HTML with your own interactions and use cases. | Share a self-contained HTML file or export images, video, and share cards. |

<details>
<summary>The engineering behind the experience</summary>


- **Layout judgment over generic auto-layout** — the agent chooses hierarchy, spacing, routes, and emphasis; shared automatic endpoints spread deterministically instead of piling arrows on one midpoint.
- **Typed JSON IR** — every renderer-backed mode has a schema and reproducible source.
- **Atomic validation before delivery** — schema, layout, HTML/SVG, route, and label-to-route clearance checks must all pass before a showcase artifact replaces the last known good output.
- **Failures come with a repair receipt** — `validate --json` and `deliver --json` return stable rule codes, the exact subject, measured evidence, and only supported repair controls instead of a Node stack or an unstructured retry guess.
- **Last-good live preview** — an optional desktop loop watches one JSON file, refreshes only after the latest candidate passes every gate, and keeps the previous verified diagram visible when a save is incomplete or invalid.
- **Truthful interaction** — focus, upstream/downstream reach, exact routes, role comparison, and stories reuse authored nodes and relationships instead of inventing topology or claiming runtime impact.
- **Source evidence, only when requested** — Evidence-backed Architecture nodes mark themselves `SRC n` and open Git-verified files and line ranges pinned to one public commit; ordinary artifacts stay source-free.
- **Portable by default** — the result is one HTML file; exports remain full-diagram and free of temporary viewer state.

Archify is not a general-purpose drawing editor or a Mermaid theme. It turns technical intent into a communication artifact.

</details>

## How it works

<details>
<summary>Generation, validation, preview, and delivery details</summary>

| Step | What happens |
|---|---|
| **Generate** | The agent creates typed JSON IR from your description. |
| **Validate** | Bundled validators and layout rules check the source; failures identify the exact local repair in machine-readable JSON. |
| **Preview (optional)** | A loopback-only desktop session watches one source and reloads only verified revisions; failures keep the last-good artifact. |
| **Deliver** | A same-directory candidate is rendered and checked; only a passing artifact atomically replaces the target, then optional `--open` launches that exact file. |
| **Iterate** | The agent updates the source while unrelated structure stays stable. |

Useful repository commands:

```bash
cd archify
node bin/archify.mjs doctor
node bin/archify.mjs demo /tmp/archify-demo
node bin/archify.mjs guide "Show CI/CD checks, approval, deploy, and rollback"
node bin/archify.mjs validate workflow examples/agent-tool-call.workflow.json --quality showcase --json
node bin/archify.mjs preview workflow examples/agent-tool-call.workflow.json /tmp/workflow.html --quality showcase
node bin/archify.mjs deliver workflow examples/agent-tool-call.workflow.json /tmp/workflow.html --quality showcase --open --json
```

`preview` is an explicit loopback-only desktop mode: it watches one JSON file on a random `127.0.0.1` port, keeps the last verified output through failures, stops with Ctrl-C, and adds no generated-HTML runtime. Use `--no-open` for tests or manual URL opening.

`deliver --open` is an opt-in one-shot handoff after commit. Opener failure preserves success; JSON remains on stdout and the absolute fallback path goes to stderr.

On failure, `validate --json` and `deliver --json` emit one JSON object. Apply only each `diagnostics[]` subject's `supportedFixes`, within the Skill's two correction rounds; visual review remains separate.

Settings:

```json
{
  "meta": {
    "locale": "en",
    "animation": "trace",
    "visual_preset": "signal-flow"
  }
}
```

`meta.locale=en|zh-CN` localizes page title, Legend, states/errors, a11y, HTML/SVG `lang`—never authored content. Otherwise omit; preserve requested-language copy; disclose English fallback. Static omits `animation`; `classic` defaults.

</details>

## Explore and share the output

| Action | Control |
|---|---|
| Open the factual Diagram Guide | <kbd>?</kbd> |
| Find and focus a semantic node | <kbd>/</kbd> |
| Trace upstream/downstream authored reach | Focus a node → `Upstream` / `Downstream` |
| Probe a directed route and inspect its journey | <kbd>R</kbd> or `PATH` |
| Compare one or two semantic roles | <kbd>L</kbd> or `LENS` |
| Open the live overview radar | <kbd>M</kbd> or `MAP` |
| Play a guided story / change chapter | <kbd>P</kbd> / <kbd>[</kbd> <kbd>]</kbd> |

| Zoom or reset | <kbd>+</kbd> / <kbd>-</kbd> / <kbd>0</kbd> |

Stable links can restore `#focus=<id>`, `#focus=<id>&reach=upstream|downstream`, `#relation=<id>`, `#route=<source>~<target>`, `#lens=<kind>~<kind>`, and `#view=<view-id>`. Reader-driven motion is finite, respects `prefers-reduced-motion`, and never enters canonical exports.

The complete generation and viewer contract lives in [`archify/SKILL.md`](archify/SKILL.md).
